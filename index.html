        <h2>User Stories</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>As a gallery owner and art walk participant, I want my shop to appear on a map with a short description so that people can find us.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>As an art walk visitor, I want to see a map of participating galleries, so that I know where I can expect to see art.</li>
            <li>As an art walk visitor, I want to see a description of the gallery and other details, so I can decide if I want to go there. (e.g. gallery name, address, description, website, hours if known.)</li>
            <li>As an art walk visitor, I want to see the map in relation to my current location, so that I have a point of reference on the map.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>As developers, we want to gather all the resources we can gather from PioneerSquare.org, to build out the data of participating art walk galleries.</li>
            <li>As developers, we want to match the current visual brand of the current PioneerSquare.org website, so that there is a consistent experience for users.</li>
            <li>As developers, we want to use Google Maps API so that our map is accurate.</li>
            <li>As developers, we want to select points on the map to display more details on the selected gallery (e.g. gallery name, address, website, open hours...)</li>
            <li>As developers, we want to store property values for each gallery in an array.</li>
            <li>As developers, we want to make this as mobile responsive as possible, so that users can access this on their mobile devices.</li>
          </ul>
